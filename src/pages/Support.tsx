                          No! TYC can be placed anywhere you want. You can put a
                          TYC:

                          TYC sticks nicely to all case materials except leather
                          and some silicone. For these types of cases, we
                          recommend either sticking the TYC underneath your case
                          (yes TYC works through most cases!).

                          For all other cases including placing directly on the

                          Shipping time within the USA is typically 3-5 business
                          days. We are currently experiencing delays due to
                          COVID-19 so shipping might take up to 2 weeks. We
                          thank you for your patience.
